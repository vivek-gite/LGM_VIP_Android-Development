## TASK 1 - Create a Covid-19 Tracker Android App to see details of any city and state in India.
The aim of this project is to create an app that can show the user how many covid cases are currently there in the country and state.

The app fetches data of the overall covid scenario in different cities and states of India using Volley API. I have used RecyclerView and ListView to show the data.

#### Preview of the app:-

## TASK 2 - Create a Face Detection Android App using ML kit on Firebase.
This is a simple app with a simple UI in which the user will be greeted with a camera button on the home page to open a camera and then it will detect the face and show the result in an alert dialog box.
